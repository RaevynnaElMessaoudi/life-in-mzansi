            <h2>The Big 5</h2>
            <p>Big Five refers to African lions, leopards, rhinoceros, elephants, and Cape buffalo.

                The phrase today is usually used to market safaris, but was first coined by big-game hunters more than
                100 years ago. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, everyone from European royalty to
                American presidents wanted to bag an African hunting trophy. The larger and more unpredictable the
                beast, the better – which is how the Big Five became famous.

                The Big Five may be dangerous, but they aren’t invincible. African lions, leopards, and elephants are
                all classed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The black
                rhinoceros is Critically Endangered and the Southern white rhino is Near Threatened, while the Northern
                white rhino is on the verge of extinction. The Cape buffalo is of the least concern in terms of
                conservation, but this also makes it the most popular animal to hunt. Hunting, poaching, and habitat
                loss combined mean the Cape buffalo’s population is also on the decline.
                There is still an active trade in legal hunting in Africa. South Africa is the biggest game hunting
                destination in the world. This practice however has undergone significant changes in implementation and
                public perception over the last century.
                <br><br>Remember Cecil the lion? This big cat’s death and subsequent photo of a dentist gloating over
                his body triggered outrage around the world and deeper examination of big game hunting in Africa.
                Arguments surrounding modern game hunting are heavily polarized.

                Defenders of game hunting say it can aid conservation efforts by generating revenue necessary to protect
                animals and their habitat – in many areas, land would be used for agriculture if it wasn’t for
                commercial hunting. Hunters also argue that they are helping to control animal populations and support
                local communities by providing jobs and income. This in turn could motivate people to protect animals
                from poaching.

                Critics argue that minimal profits reach local communities, and that whether or not hunting supports
                conservation relies on the appropriate management of funds raised and sustainable allocation of animal
                quotas. Inadequate monitoring makes these factors difficult to control.

                <br><br>Either way, trophy hunting is big business in South Africa. According to Africa Check, around
                8,500 trophy hunters visit South Africa each year, compared to 9.5 million tourists. These hunters spend
                more than the average tourist, averaging around $10,000 per hunting trip. Trophy hunting generates an
                estimated $100 million a year, says South Africa’s DEA.
