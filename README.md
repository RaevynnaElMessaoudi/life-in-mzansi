<h3 id="overview3"> What does it do?</h3>

Life in Mzansi has several pages of information that briefly outline what life in South Africa is like. There also links to external websites that can help expand on certain topics. It does this by focusing on the four main pillars of life in South Africa, namely Culture, Wildlife, History and Geography. Users will have a decent knowledge of South Africa by the time they are done with the website. 

<h3 id="overview4">How does it work?</h3>

Life in Mzansi was created with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. There are 5 pages in total that are navigated using the menu located at the top of the website beneath the website logo. This project was developed on Gitpod and deployed on Github. The site can viewed [here](https://raeel97.github.io/life-in-mzansi/)

<h2 id="features1">Features</h2>

<h3 id="features2">Existing Features</h3>

- A stylish front page with a hero image and short introduction that explains the purpose of the website and the reason behind its naming. 
- A logo that links to the home page. The logo incorporates the South African flag.
- The website incorporate the colors of the South African flag to add to the user experience, this can be seen in the headings of each page, the buttons of the menu, the borders around each image and the external links in the footer. 
The body of the website is black and each page is styled to represent one of the 5 other colors present in the South African flag. The home page is white, geography page is green, culture page is red, wildlife page is yellow and the history page is blue.
