# Life in Mzansi

## Overview

### What is this website for?

Life in Mzansi is a website that aims to provide information about life in South Africa. This site will be targeted towards anyone with an interest in learning about South Africa, its geography, cultures, wildlife and history.

### What does it do?

Life in Mzansi has several pages of information that briefly outline what life in South Africa is like. There also links to external websites that can help expand on certain topics. It does this by focusing on the four main pillars of life in South Africa, namely Culture, Wildlife, History and Geography. Users will have a decent knowledge of South Africa by the time they are done with the website. 

### How does it work?

Life in Mzansi was created with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. There are 5 pages in total that are navigated using the menu located at the top of the website beneath the website logo. This project was developed on Gitpod and deployed on Github. The site can viewed [here](https://raeel97.github.io/life-in-mzansi/)
